# DroneHackAI23



This project was created for Ohio State's yearly Artificial Intelligence Hackathon. The team consists of Rahul, Raagul, and Marty. All second year engineering students at OSU. 

What is our project? 

We target large land owners, farmers, every homeowners, etc whom are scared of intruders, wild animals, and increasing land saftey. Our team has fixed that problem by creating a security drone. The drone flys around the perimeter of the owners designated area multiple times a day of the owners choosing to make sure their property remains safe. A recording of the drone flight will then be sent to the owner via text message or through an application. The recording will spot object detection, it can identify animals, people, and etc. 

What we plan to have: 

SolidWorks file: 
  - Base charging station (return homepoint for drone)
  
  Python Script: 
  - Object detection 
  - Face detection 
  - Autonomous Survellinace flight 
  
  Presentation: 
  - Team's accomplishments 
  - Team presentation 
  etc. 

Update: The team placed 2nd for the general hackathon!!
